# Search Engine 
A two-person project in which a search engine capable of loading data from datasets up to 300,000 articles, storing said data in a persistence file, and finding articles containing the search query was implemented. The search was done via an inverted file index that utilizes a custom avl tree class created by the programmer, and in order to index organizations and persons, a custom hashtable class was created.
Path to file containing articles to be specified in the program(size-6000). See pdf for more.
